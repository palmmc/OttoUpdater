# Tutorial
### *Using In-Game UI*
1) With **operator** or the `easyas.command.editshop` permission, run the `/editshop` command.
2) This is the first layer of configuration, where you can edit things like the title and content of the UI.
   - Next click "Edit Categories"
3) Here you can add or remove a cateegory, or edit existing categories by clicking them.
   - Click the 'Blocks' category to edit it.
4) Now, inside this category, you can add or remove items and subcategories, as well as edit existing ones.
   - Try adding a new entry for diamonds; use the ID '`minecraft:diamond`', and the path "`textures/items/diamond.png`".
   - The rest you can choose!
5) Once you've done that, you will be taken to your new entry in the shop.
   - If you want, try buying one!
### *Using JSON Editor*
1) For more advanced users, a more efficient approach is to edit the JSON directly.
To start, navigate to your `/bedrock_server/config/` folder; the `/config/` folder should be in the same directory as your `/plugins/` folder.
2) Open `shop.json` in your choice of text editor. You don't need anything fancy; Notepad will do.
3) Begin editing. Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/palmmc/EasyAsShops/wiki/Editing-with-JSON) for available arguments.
Once done, save the file and reload/restart your server for the changes to take effect.

### ðŸ¥³ Congratulations!
You've added your first item to the shop!
What will you add next? It's up to you! Have fun with it!
